    # Finally we want to make the commit message available to other jobs. This can be done with job-level outputs

    #
    # For **Pull Request** events this will resolve to something like "$( [ -z "commit message pr" ] && echo "" || echo "commit message pr" )" which then resolves to just "commit message pr"
    #
    # For **Push** events this will resolve to something like "$( [ -z "" ] && echo "commit message push"  || echo "" )" which then resolves to just "commit message push"
