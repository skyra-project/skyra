## Story
**A bit of story**: Skyra, formerly known as kyraBOT (renamed in the middle of March of 2017), is a standalone Discord Bot that was born out of curiosity in a SoloLearn guild. With help from other developers, due to my lack of experience (I made websites and templates for After Effects, but never a backend application) Skyra was born. Skyra's name comes from a comment made by a user, joining "kyra" with "SkyNET", creating "SkyraNET", I liked the name and later, she got renamed to "Skyra". Originally, it was going to be renamed as "Shiny" (name taken for the currency) however I decided against this.

Skyra does not only feature almost every single feature that is needed in the majority of guilds (discord servers) while being completely configurable, she also has a backstory, inherited from the lore I have been creating since I was a child.

There have been over 12 rewrites with an active development of over a year, I have met many developers and friends in Discord, and in February 2017, I met the Dirigeants team, upon which I started to contribute to Komada, and later, for Klasa. Nowadays, Klasa holds the open-source part of Skyra.
